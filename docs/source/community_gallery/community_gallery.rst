Community Gallery
***************************

This page is a collection of community conversion and analysis projects cataloged here as a convenient reference for NWB users. This list is not comprehensive and many of the projects and resources are built and supported by other groups, and are in active development. If you would like to contribute a project or resources, please see the instructions :nwb-overview-src:`here <>`.


Data Conversion
---------------

:neuroconv-docs:`NeuroConv Catalog <catalogue/catalogue.html>` is a collection of real-world examples of labs using :neuroconv-docs:`NeuroConv <>` to convert their data to NWB files. Each project listed contains a description and a link to an open GitHub repository. Many of the projects listed use advanced customization features beyond what is demonstrated in the core :neuroconv-docs:`NeuroConv conversion gallery <conversion_examples_gallery/conversion_example_gallery.html>`

The Bristol Neuroscience Data Guide includes tutorials for converting data to NWB for `extracellular electrophysiology data <https://dervinism.github.io/bristol-neuroscience-data-guide/tutorials/Bristol%20GIN%20for%20Silicon%20Probe%20Data.html>`_   and `optical physiology data <https://dervinism.github.io/bristol-neuroscience-data-guide/tutorials/Bristol%20GIN%20for%20Calcium%20Imaging%20Data.html>`_ using both the :pynwb-docs:`PyNWB <>` and :matnwb-docs:`MatNWB <>` APIs for NWB.

Data Analysis and Reuse
-----------------------

:ref:`analysistools-dandi` (Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration) maintains a `collection of example notebooks <https://github.com/dandi/example-notebooks>`_ associated with datasets, conference tools, or more generally notebooks that illustrate the use of data on DANDI. In addition, the broader community provides additional examples demonstrating the reuse of NWB data published on DANDI, e.g.:

* The `INCF working group on NWB <https://www.incf.org/sig/incf-working-group-nwb>`_ has created a `library of MATLAB examples <https://github.com/INCF/example-live-scripts>`_ using DANDI datasets authored as MATLAB live scripts

The :openscope-databook:`OpenScope Databook <>` provides scripts and documentation used for brain data analysis and visualization, primarily working with NWB files and the :ref:`analysistools-dandi` archive. Through :jupyter-book:`Jupyter Book <>`, this code is structured as a series of notebooks intended to explain and educate users on how to work with brain data. This resource is provided by the Allen Institute’s :openscope-project:`OpenScope Project <>`, an endeavor of The Allen Institute :mindscope-program:`Mindscope Program <>`. OpenScope is a platform for high-throughput and reproducible neurophysiology open to external scientists to test theories of brain function.
