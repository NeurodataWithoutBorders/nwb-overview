.. short_description_start

:ref:`analysistools-extract` is a Tractable and Robust Automated Cell extraction Tool for calcium imaging,
which *extracts* the activities of cells as time series from both one-photon and two-photon Ca2+ imaging movies.
EXTRACT makes minimal assumptions about the data, which is the main reason behind its high robustness and superior
performance.
