:ref:`analysistools-cebra` is a machine-learning method that can be used to compress time series in a way that reveals otherwise hidden structures in the variability of the data. It excels on behavioural and neural data recorded simultaneously, and it can decode activity from the visual cortex of the mouse brain to reconstruct a viewed video.
