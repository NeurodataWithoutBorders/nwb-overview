.. short_description_start

:ref:`analysistools-spyglass` is a framework for building your analysis workflows with a focus on reproducibility and sharing. Spyglass uses community-developed open-source projects such as NWB and DataJoint to manage data in a shareable format, build and run pipelines and store their inputs and outputs in a relational database, and generate visualizations of analysis results for sharing with the community. It comes with ready-to-use pipelines for spike sorting, LFP analysis, position processing, and fitting of state space models for decoding variables of interest from neural data.
