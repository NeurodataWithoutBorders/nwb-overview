This page is a collection of community conversion and analysis projects cataloged here as a convenient reference for NWB users. This list is not comprehensive and many of the projects and resources are built and supported by other groups, and are in active development. If you would like to contribute a project or resources, please see the instructions :nwb-overview-src:`here <>`.

:neuroconv-docs:`NeuroConv Catalog <catalogue/catalogue.html>` is a collection of real-world examples of labs using :neuroconv-docs:`NeuroConv <>` to convert their data to NWB files. Each project listed contains a description and a link to an open GitHub repository. Many of the projects listed use advanced customization features beyond what is demonstrated in the core :neuroconv-docs:`NeuroConv conversion gallery <conversion_examples_gallery/conversion_example_gallery.html>`
