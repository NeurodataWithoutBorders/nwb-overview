:ref:`analysistools-pynapple` is a unified toolbox for integrated analysis of multiple data sources. Designed to be "plug & play", users define and import their own time-relevant variables. Supported data sources include, but are not limited to, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and motion capture data. Pynapple contains integrated functions for common neuroscience analyses, including cross-correlograms, tuning curves, decoding and perievent time histogram.
