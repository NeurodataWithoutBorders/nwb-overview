:ref:`analysistools-neo` Neo is a Python package for working with
electrophysiology data in Python, together with support for reading
and writing a wide range of neurophysiology file format (see the
`list of supported formats <https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/io.html?highlight=NWBIO#module-neo.io>`_).
The goal of Neo is to improve interoperability between Python tools for analyzing,
visualizing and generating electrophysiology data, by providing a common, shared
object model. In order to be as lightweight a dependency as possible, Neo
is deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis
or visualization. :bdg-link-primary:`Docs <https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`
