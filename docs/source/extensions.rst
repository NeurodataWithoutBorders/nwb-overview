NWB Extensions (NDX) Catalog
============================

The :ndx-catalog:`NDX Catalog website <>` contains published
extensions created by the community to add support for a wide variety of data types.
Before creating your own extension, we recommend that you explore the Catalog to
make sure that someone has not already created an extension that suits your needs
or that you could build off of.

NWB Enhancement Proposals (NEPs)
================================

The NWB data standard is not static but evolves to adapt to changing needs from the neuroscience community, 
clarify ambiguities, and fix bugs, among others. Users can propose smaller changes, such as improvements to
documentation or addition of a new optional field to an existing data type, on the 
:nwb-schema-src:`NWB Schema GitHub repository <>`. Users can propose larger changes, such as addition of 
several new data types to support a new data modality, or a major restructuring of existing data types, 
through NWB Enhancement Proposals (NEPs).

NEPs are often collaborative and led by members of the community to address a significant need by the 
community. Here is a list of NEPs that have been started:

Review of NEPs for acceptance to the NWB core data standard is led by the 
:nwb-tab:`NWB Technical Advisory Board (TAB) <>`
and involves several phases. To submit a NEP for review and explore previous NEP reviews, see the 
:nep-review:`NEP Review GitHub repo <>`. For more information on the NEP process, see the following links:

- `Proposal Review Process: process by which extensions to the NWB core standard are proposed, evaluated, reviewed, and accepted <https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR7v4ixgnaCsJSbKji5eGWxb5muzV1M82zA-D2IswZD_KOt7HiUjcXKpTko0lqcBAD-MTd44rqFCf-V/pub>`_
- `Working Groups for Evaluating NEPs Policy: process for evaluation and review of NWB Extension Proposals (NEPs) by a review working group (RWG) to provide guidance and a formal framework for RWG members. <https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTpDnWFpD2YDuYKXzd-6svH6ceXNBz4wOauoZivvZpQgLPYBz6yv7-eihJceBtgGTDV_TcMX9xboNsm/pub>`_
